# PHPForBegginers
and Udemy course, PHP for Begginers, 
this is one of the courses that I compleeted in PHP during my Internship at BrickField Education Labs. 

https://www.udemy.com/share/101xdiAEEdd1hRRX0I/

the hello.php file has the start of the project, with losing pieces of code and example of variables in php. 

The other files, are the code for a Blog, with the full CRUD (create Read Update and Delete)
this blog is linked with the data in a DataBase.

Login functionality included.

PDO (PhP Data Objects) were included at the midle of the course

Security mesuments: Session Attacks, SQL injections, and Hash code were considered, and inserted in this project as well. 

it doesnt include sign in function, the login needs to be created using the database, or hard coded inside the code. 

the hash code here were used just as example file, and it were not inserted inside the body of the code, to hash the database.
